## 1 Introduction

The [3DViewer](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/114764/) module lets you visualize and operate on 3D JT Models on browser. The module contains Java actions, JavaScript actions, domain models, micro-flows and a set of 3D widgets that enable you build app to work with JT models . All you need to do is drag and drop items and configure them. This avoids building 3D rendering liba
### 1.1 Typical Use Cases 
You can use the module when you want to upload, store and visualize 3D JT models in your application, and perform some basic operations such us  model product structure tree, PMI Tree.
Features: (Version 1)
- Displays JT files (both shattered and monolithic)
- Product Structure Navigation and part search
- Zoom, rotate, fit all
- Ability to turn parts on and off
- Displays PMI
- Ability to select and deselect parts
- Display Model Views
- Loading models from VisService, Teamcenter, application server file system
- Display part/assembly properties
- Quick intuitive controls to nagivate a product structure 
- Create 3D cross sections
- Examine your model from preset viewing angles 

Visualization Tools Available: (Version 2)
- 3D Navigation (Rotate and zoom 3D Models)
- 3D PS (Navigate product structure trees)
- 3D PMI (View PMI in your model)
- 3D Selection (Select parts and pick part features)
- 3D Section (Create 3D cross sections)
- 3D Standard Views (Examine your model from preset viewing angles)
